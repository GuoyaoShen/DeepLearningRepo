# DeepLearningRepo
This is a repo corresponding to CIS522, Deep Learning
* Part1: Basic warmup with scikit-learn and pytorch
* Part2: This part mainly works with network diagnoise, with fashion-MNIST as dataset.
* Part3: This part mainly works with images. Including traditional image classifier, transfer learning, CAE, VAE and GAN.
* Part4: This part mainly works with text, including RNN, self-attention model, transfer learning and seq2seq model.
* Part5: This part mainly works with reinforcement learning, with deep-q learning as instance.
