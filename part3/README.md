# Part3
This part mainly works with images. Including traditional image classifier, transfer learning, CAE, VAE and GAN.
## CAE

  One of the many useful qualities of a VAE is that the resulting code vector has interpretable properties, which
  means we can use the coded vector to interpolate between two images. Below shows an example of this.
